            <h1><b>Who was Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata?</b></h1>
        <h5><strong>Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata (3 March 1839 - 19 May 1904) was an Indian pioneer industrialist who founded the Tata Group, India's biggest conglomerate company. 
            Named the greatest philanthropist of the last century by several polls and ranking lists.He also established the city 
            of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamshedpur">Jamshedpur</a>.</strong></h5>
            <p>Jamshedji Tata is regarded as the legendary "Father of Indian Industry". He was so influential in the world of industry that Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Tata as a One-Man Planning Commission.

                "When you have to give the lead in action, in ideas - a lead which does not fit in with the very climate of opinion - that is true courage, physical or mental or spiritual, 
                call it what you like, and it is this 
                type of courage and vision that Jamshedji Tata showed. 
                It is right that we should honour his memory and remember him as one of the big founders of modern India." â€”Jawaharlal Nehru
                Tata, who in his early life was a merchant, went on to change the business world of India through his many ventures within the cotton and pig iron industry, and is known 
                as one of the most important builders of the modern Indian economy.
                 Out of his many achievements, Tata is particularly notable for the Tata Iron and Steel Works company in Jamshedpur.
                
                Tata was ranked first in the "Hurun Philanthropists of the Century" (2021) by total donations of nearly $102.4 billion with the start of his key endowments way back in 1892.
            </p>
            <p>Jamshedji donated generously mainly for education and healthcare. He was named the greatest philanthrope of the last century by EdelGive Foundation and Hurun Research India. He topped the 
                list of the world's top philanthropists of the 20th century with an estimated donation of $102 billion adjusted for inflation </p>
